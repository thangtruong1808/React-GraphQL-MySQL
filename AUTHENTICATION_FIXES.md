# Authentication System Fixes

## Problem Summary

The authentication system was not properly tracking user activity, causing users to be logged out even when they were actively using the application. The system was only tracking navigation events and not basic user interactions like mouse movements, keystrokes, and clicks.

## Root Cause

The `useActivityTracker` hook was only monitoring:
- Route changes (navigation)
- `beforeunload` events

It was missing essential user interaction events like:
- Mouse movements, clicks, and scroll events
- Keyboard input (keystrokes)
- Touch interactions
- Form interactions

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Activity Tracking (`client/src/hooks/custom/useActivityTracker.ts`)

**Before:**
- Only tracked navigation and `beforeunload` events
- Limited user interaction detection

**After:**
- Comprehensive user interaction tracking including:
  - Mouse: `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `click`, `dblclick`, `mousemove`, `wheel`
  - Keyboard: `keydown`, `keyup`, `keypress`
  - Touch: `touchstart`, `touchend`, `touchmove`
  - Scroll: `scroll`
  - Forms: `focus`, `blur`, `input`, `change`, `submit`
  - Navigation: `beforeunload`

**Performance Optimizations:**
- High-frequency events (mousemove, scroll) are throttled to update activity at most once per second
- Event listeners use `passive: true` for better performance
- System-generated events are filtered out using `event.isTrusted`
- Event listeners are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

### 2. Updated Configuration Constants

**Client Constants (`client/src/constants/index.ts`):**
```typescript
ACTIVITY_CHECK_INTERVAL: 3000, // Check user activity every 3 seconds (was 30 seconds)
INACTIVITY_THRESHOLD: 2 * 60 * 1000, // 2 minutes of inactivity before logout
```

**Server Constants (`server/constants/index.ts`):**
```typescript
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY: '2m', // 2 minutes (was incorrectly commented as 5 minutes)
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY: '10m', // 10 minutes
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY_MS: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes in milliseconds
```

### 3. Fixed Token Management (`client/src/utils/tokenManager.ts`)

**Before:**
- Refresh token expiry was hardcoded to 2 minutes

**After:**
- Refresh token expiry matches server configuration (10 minutes)

### 4. Updated Authentication Logic (`client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Token Refresh Logic:**
- Now refreshes tokens when they're more than halfway through their 2-minute lifetime (1 minute)
- Previously was set to 30 seconds (half of 1 minute)

### 5. Added Debug Component (`client/src/components/debug/ActivityDebugger.tsx`)

- Real-time display of authentication status
- Token expiry countdown
- Activity tracking verification
- Only visible in development mode

## Authentication Flow

### Expected Behavior

1. **Active User**: When users interact with the application (mouse, keyboard, touch, etc.), their activity timestamp is updated
2. **Token Refresh**: Active users get their access tokens refreshed proactively (when token is more than halfway through its 2-minute lifetime)
3. **Inactive User**: Users who don't interact for 2 minutes are automatically logged out
4. **Absolute Timeout**: Users are logged out after 10 minutes regardless of activity (refresh token expiry)

### Configuration Summary

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY | 2 minutes | Short-lived token for security |
| REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY | 10 minutes | Absolute session timeout |
| ACTIVITY_CHECK_INTERVAL | 3 seconds | How often to check for inactivity |
| INACTIVITY_THRESHOLD | 2 minutes | How long to wait before logging out inactive users |

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Manual Testing

1. **Login to the application**
2. **Verify active user behavior:**
   - Move your mouse around the page
   - Type in any input fields
   - Click on buttons and links
   - Scroll the page
   - Navigate between pages
   - **Expected**: User should remain logged in

3. **Test inactivity logout:**
   - Stop all interactions (don't move mouse, don't type, don't click)
   - Wait for 2 minutes
   - **Expected**: User should be automatically logged out

4. **Test token refresh:**
   - Use the debug component (blue "Show Debug" button in bottom-right corner)
   - Monitor the "Time Until Expiry" counter
   - Continue using the application actively
   - **Expected**: Token should refresh when it gets below 1 minute remaining

### 2. Debug Component

The debug component provides real-time information:
- Authentication status
- Token presence and expiry times
- Countdown to token expiry
- User information

**To use:**
1. Click the blue "Show Debug" button in the bottom-right corner
2. Monitor the information while using the application
3. Verify that activity updates the timestamp and prevents logout

### 3. Console Logs

The system provides detailed console logging:
- `‚úÖ User interaction detected: [event-type]` - When user activity is detected
- `üîÑ Refreshing access token due to user activity...` - When tokens are refreshed
- `üîê User inactive for too long, performing logout...` - When user is logged out due to inactivity
- `üîê Access token expired, performing logout...` - When access token expires

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/hooks/custom/useActivityTracker.ts` - Enhanced activity tracking
2. `client/src/constants/index.ts` - Updated activity check interval
3. `server/constants/index.ts` - Fixed access token expiry comment
4. `client/src/utils/tokenManager.ts` - Fixed refresh token expiry
5. `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated token refresh logic
6. `client/src/components/debug/ActivityDebugger.tsx` - New debug component
7. `client/src/App.tsx` - Added debug component
8. `client/src/hooks/custom/README.md` - Updated documentation

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Performance**: Throttled high-frequency events, used passive event listeners
2. **Security**: Filtered system-generated events, proper cleanup
3. **User Experience**: Comprehensive interaction tracking, proactive token refresh
4. **Maintainability**: Clear comments, centralized configuration, proper error handling
5. **Testing**: Debug component for verification, detailed console logging

## Notes

- The debug component is only visible in development mode (`import.meta.env.PROD` check)
- All constants are centralized and follow the existing configuration pattern
- No database tables are dropped or modified
- No internal secrets are exposed
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing components
